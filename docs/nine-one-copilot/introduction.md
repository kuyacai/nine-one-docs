## Overview

In today's rapidly evolving digital and intelligent world, artificial intelligence (AI) has become an indispensable part of our daily lives and work. To meet the needs of individual users for efficient and personalized AI services, Nine One AI offers the following two core services:

### Integrated API Services

We provide an integrated API platform that allows users to access AI services from multiple large language model providers through a single interface. This one-stop service greatly simplifies the user's operation process and improves work efficiency. The main features of the integrated API include:

- **Unified interface:** Users don't need to learn the API interfaces of different providers separately. We provide a unified access method, making integration and calling simple and quick.
- **Multi-source access:** Users can easily access a variety of AI services, including OpenAI's ChatGPT and large language models from other providers like MoonShot.
- **Flexibility:** Whether users need text generation, language understanding, or other AI functions, our API can provide the corresponding support.

### Desktop Software Service

In addition to integrated API services, Nine One AI has developed a desktop software - Nine One Copilot, aimed at providing users with a richer localized AI experience. This software has the following advantages:

- **Multi-model access:** The software supports connecting to large language models from multiple AI service providers, allowing users to choose based on their personal preferences.
- **Integrated functions:** In addition to basic text processing functions, the software also integrates advanced features such as Agent, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and an intelligent dialogue toolkit.
- **Cross-platform:** Supports Windows and Mac OS systems, and a Linux version will be available in the future.
- **Personalized experience:** Users can customize the software interface and functions according to their needs, enjoying a highly personalized AI service.

Through these two services, Nine One aims to provide users with a comprehensive, efficient, and personalized AI solution that can play an important role in office automation, content creation, and daily life assistance.
