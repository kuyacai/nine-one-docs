## Moonshot AI

Moonshot AI, founded in March 2023, is dedicated to finding the optimal solution for transforming energy into intelligence. Through our products, we co-create intelligence with our users. In October 2023, we launched Kimi, an intelligent assistant that supports up to 200,000 Chinese characters as input.

### Available Models

Moonshot offers the following models:

- **moonshot-v1-8k**: Suitable for generating short text, with a maximum context length of 8k tokens.
- **moonshot-v1-32k**: Suitable for generating long text, with a maximum context length of 32k tokens.
- **moonshot-v1-128k**: Suitable for generating extra-long text, with a maximum context length of 128k tokens.

The main difference between these models is their maximum context length, which includes both the input prompt and the generated output. There is no significant difference in their performance; the choice primarily depends on the length of text you need to process.

### Getting Your API Key

To use these models, you'll need an API key. Visit the [Moonshot Console](https://platform.moonshot.cn/console) to create one.
