## Is Nine One AI free?

Nine One AI provides two types of services. One is the Nine One aggregated API service, which is similar to most large language model service providers and requires a fee. You can choose a suitable payment plan based on your specific needs. Of course, if you are a new user, you can enjoy a free trial of 2 million tokens for the API service.

The Nine One Copilot client provided by Nine One AI is free.

## Do I need to register to use Nine One AI?

If you use the Nine One aggregated API service, you need to register to obtain an API key.

If you only use Nine One Copilot, registration is not required.
