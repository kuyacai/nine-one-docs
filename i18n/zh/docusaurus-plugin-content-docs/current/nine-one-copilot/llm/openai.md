If you find setting up the API Key via environment variables cumbersome, you can use the method provided by Nine One Copilot. Note: We do not store your API Key on our servers; it will be saved locally on your computer. For security reasons, we recommend regularly changing your API Key. Click the settings button in the image above to open the following window.

In most cases, you do not need to fill in the Base URL. Simply enter the API Key and Organization details you obtained from OpenAI into the corresponding input fields. If you are in a region where OpenAI services are not accessible, you can try setting up a Proxy. However, as of August 5, 2024, this solution may not always work.

If you are unable to use the service, please contact us, and we will provide you with a solution.
