<p>Nine One AI is committed to respecting the intellectual property rights of others. It is our policy to address any claim that Content posted on our Service infringes on the copyright or other intellectual property rights of any individual. If you are a copyright holder, or are authorized to act on behalf of one, and believe that your copyrighted work has been copied in a manner that constitutes copyright infringement through our Service, you must submit a written notice to our copyright agent at <a href="mailto:contact@nineone.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contact@nineone.ai</a>, detailing the alleged infringement. Misrepresentation of any Content as infringing your copyright may result in you being held liable for damages (including costs and attorneys&#x27; fees).</p>
<p>In adherence to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), we have adopted a policy to combat copyright infringement. The contact information for our Designated Agent to Receive Notification of Claimed Infringement is provided at the end of this section. Our policy includes: (1) removing access to or eliminating material we believe in good faith to be copyrighted material that has been illicitly copied and distributed by our advertisers, affiliates, content providers, members, or users; and (2) discontinuing service to repeat offenders.</p>
<p>Procedure for Reporting Copyright Infringements:</p>
<p>If you believe that material or content on or accessible through our Services infringes a copyright, please send a notice of copyright infringement to our Designated Agent with the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li>A physical or electronic signature of the individual authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner;</li>
<li>Identification of the copyrighted works or materials being infringed;</li>
<li>Detailed identification of the material claimed to be infringing, including its location, to allow us to locate and verify its existence;</li>
<li>Your contact information, including address, telephone number, and email address if available;</li>
<li>A statement of good faith belief that the material identified is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;</li>
<li>A statement, made under penalty of perjury, that the information provided is accurate and that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.</li>
</ol>
<p>Upon Receipt of a Valid Infringement Notification:</p>
<p>Our policy dictates the following actions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Removal or disabling of access to the infringing material;</li>
<li>Notification to the content provider, member, or user that access has been removed or disabled;</li>
<li>Termination of access to the Services for repeat offenders.</li>
</ol>
<p>Procedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent:</p>
<p>If the content provider, member, or user believes that material removed (or access disabled) is not infringing, or they have the right to post and use such material, they must send a counter-notice to our Designated Agent with the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li>A physical or electronic signature of the content provider, member, or user;</li>
<li>Identification of the material removed or access disabled, and its previous location;</li>
<li>A statement of good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled due to mistake or misidentification;</li>
<li>The provider&#x27;s, member&#x27;s, or user&#x27;s name, address, telephone number, and email address (if available), along with consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court where the provider, member, or user is located, or where the company is located if outside the United States, and an agreement to accept service of process from the notifier of the alleged infringement.</li>
</ol>
<p>Upon receiving a counter-notice, we may forward it to the original complaining party, informing them that we may reinstate the removed material or cease disabling access in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner initiates legal action against the content provider, member, or user, the material may be restored or access to it may be re-enabled after 10 to 14 business days, at our discretion.</p>
